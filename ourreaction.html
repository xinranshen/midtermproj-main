      The user experience of the blog is very indicative of its time. You immediately find yourself immersed in a magazine column-like blog of Marisa’s arc as an American Idol hopeful. It’s easy to navigate as all the menus/sections are on the left side, with the content on the right.

      Even though the artwork may seem dated now, I think it was ahead of its time as blogs were only a decade old. Creating this “concept blog” that basically had an expiration date was a very innovative idea for a performance art piece in my opinion.
